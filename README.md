# E-Commerce
The project is an e-commerce application that allows customers to browse and purchase products online. It includes several functionalities such as customer registration, product search, order placement, and payment processing.

Customers can create an account by registering with their personal details such as name, email, and mobile number. They can then search for products by name or category, view product details such as price and description, and add them to their cart. Once they have selected their desired products, they can place an order and proceed to payment using one of the available payment methods.

The application also includes a feature for multiple product order placement where a customer can add multiple products to the cart and place them in a single order.

In addition, the application has an admin section where authorized personnel can manage the products, view orders, and update the order status.
